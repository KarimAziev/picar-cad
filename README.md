## Overview

The robot model is designed around the following core elements:

- **Ackermann Steering**: Front wheels are steered via a pinion and rack assembly driven by a standard servo.
- **Rear-Wheel Drive**: Two individual motors drive the rear wheels. Both standard yellow DC motors and N20-type motors are supported.
- **Modular Head Mount**: The head mount is designed to accommodate two Raspberry Pi Camera Module 2 or more sensors (e.g., day/night configuration).
- **Extendable Power Tiers**: Side and center slots allow for independent modules for power management: servo driver HAT, motor driver HAT, UPS for Raspberry Pi 5, etc.
- **Raspberry Pi**: The chassis includes placements and screw holes for the Raspberry Pi 5 and multiple 18650 battery holders.

## Structure

The project is organized into several reusable modules under the scad/ directory:

- `parameters.scad`: Central configuration file containing physical dimensions (units are in millimeters).
- `printable.scad`: Contains all printable parts in one place. Different colors indicate the recommended filament type: white for PLA, dark blue for PETG CF or PLA CF (PLA is also acceptable), and black for TPU (used only for tires).

- `assembly.scad`: Fully assembled view of the robot.
  ![Demo](./demo/picar-cad-assembly-view.gif)
- `steering_system/`: Rack-and-pinion steering system based on Ackermann geometry.
- `head/`: Mounting system for dual Raspberry Pi cameras.
- `motor_brackets/`: Brackets for both standard (yellow) and N20-style motors.
- `wheels/`: Components for rear and front wheels, including hubs and tires.
- `placeholders/`: Placeholder geometry for components such as the Raspberry Pi, servos, DC motors, battery holders, and HATs.

## External Details

All of this details are just recommendations, you can use any other details, just don't forget to specify corresponding dimensions in `parameters.scad`.

### Bearings

- Two 685 (_5x11x5_) bearings, inserted into the steering knuckles. To use different sizes, modify the variable `knuckle_bearing_outer_dia` and other relevant variables.
- Two 693 (_3x8x4_) bearings, inserted into the bearing connectors. Both flanged and standard versions are supported.
- Two 608 (_8x22x7_) bearings, inserted into the front wheels.

### Servos

This project supports three EMAX ES08MA II servos by default. If using different models, update the following variables in `parameters.scad`:

- `steering_servo_slot_width` and `steering_servo_slot_height` for the steering servo
- `head_neck_pan_servo_slot_width` and `head_neck_pan_servo_slot_height` for the pan servo
- `head_neck_tilt_servo_slot_width` and `head_neck_tilt_servo_slot_height` for the tilt servo

### Raspberry Pi

Raspberry Pi 5 is supported by default. To use a different model, adjust the relevant variables prefixed with `rpi_` (e.g., `rpi_screws_size`).

### Power Supply

You can use battery holders, a [UPS module S3](https://www.waveshare.com/ups-module-3s.html), or both. The default configuration supports two 18650 battery holders along with an S3 UPS module.

### Motors

Two rear motors are supported-either standard or N20-type:

- The "N20" type refers to motors like the **GA12-N20** with a 3 mm shaft.
- The "standard" type refers to widely available yellow gear motors with a 5 mm shaft.

Rear wheel shaft size depends on the motor type. Use the variable `motor_type` in `parameters.scad` to set the proper shaft diameter.

### Camera Module

The design supports one or two camera modules. The default dimensions are compatible with the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3.

### Ultrasonic

The model supports Ultrasonic HC-SR04.

### IR LED

The design also supports case for [IR Waveshare Infrared LED Light Board Module](https://www.waveshare.com/infrared-led-board.html).

The original LED board is incompatible with the Raspberry Camera Module 3, and the quality of Waveshareâ€™s original camera is unsatisfactory.

Nevertheless, this LED board can be used with Camera Module 3 and other Raspberry Pi cameras. To do so, solder two wires (**GND** and **V+**) to the screw holes on the LED board (the screw holes serve both for mechanical attachment and for power). Then connect the positive wire to **3.3V** and the ground wire to **GND**.

### Screws and Nuts

Since the default chassis thickness is **4 mm** (changeable via the variable `chassis_thickness`), use screws at least **8 mm** long for fastenings that go through the chassis, depending on the nuts. I suggest using lock nuts for these screws, but plain nuts are also acceptable.

The tables below are grouped by component. I haven't combined them into a single table with total quantities because totals depend on which components you use - for example, you may or may not include the UPS Module S3.

Each table includes a "Variable" column that refers to a configurable variable in parameters.scad. You can change it to the screw diameter you want to use.

#### Steering panel

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount | Nuts | Variable                         |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | -------------------------------- |
| M2.5 | 8           | 4      | 2    | `steering_panel_hinge_screw_dia` |
| M2   | 8           | 1      | 1    | `steering_servo_screw_dia`       |
| M2   | 4           | 1      | 0    | `steering_servo_screw_dia`       |

#### Steering pinion

Your servo pack should already include screws, a servo arm, and self-tapping screws to secure the servo arm, but I'll list them here for reference as well.

##### For Servo gear

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount | Nuts | Variable                   |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | -------------------------- |
| M2   | 4           | 1      | 0    | `steering_servo_screw_dia` |

> [!TIP]
> The variable `steering_servo_screw_dia` is used only in assembly views, but there are useful variables that define the diameter of the hole at the center of the pinion where you insert the servo's gearbox - `steering_pinion_center_hole_dia`. Its default size is **6.5** mm.

##### Self-tapping screws for servo arm

Self-tapping screws should also be included in your pack. The diameter may differ slightly, but the screws should still fit due to the nature of self-tapping screws.

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount    | Nuts | Variable                    |
| ---- | ----------- | --------- | ---- | --------------------------- |
| M1.5 | 4           | 2 or more | 0    | `steering_pinion_screw_dia` |

#### Raspberry Pi

The exact screw length depends on the standoffs you use. Since the default chassis thickness is 4 mm, you should use screws that are at least 6 mm long.

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount | Nuts/Standoffs | Variable             |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | -------------- | -------------------- |
| M2   | 6 or higher | 4      | 4              | `rpi_screw_hole_dia` |

#### Battery holder

You can attach one or two battery holders to the bottom of the chassis.

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount | Nuts | Variable                        |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | ------------------------------- |
| M2.5 | 8 or higher | 2      | 1    | `battery_holder_screw_hole_dia` |

#### UPS module S3

You should use either 4 or 8 M3 standoffs. If you use 8 standoffs, the nuts listed below are not needed.

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount | Nuts | Variable                     |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | ---------------------------- |
| M3   | 8 or higher | 4      | 4    | `battery_ups_screw_hole_dia` |

#### Motor brackets

##### For two N20 motors

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount | Nuts | Variable               |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | ---------------------- |
| M2.5 | 8 or higher | 4      | 4    | `n20_motor_screws_dia` |

##### For two standard (yellow) motors

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount | Nuts | Variable                                    |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| M3   | 28          | 4      | 4    | `standard_motor_bracket_motor_screw_hole`   |
| M2   | 8 or higher | 4      | 4    | `standard_motor_bracket_chassis_screw_hole` |

#### Head

##### For two Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 boards

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount                | Nuts | Variable                |
| ---- | ----------- | --------------------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| M2   | 4 or higher | 8 (4 for each camera) | 8    | `head_camera_screw_dia` |

As with the steering servo, your servo pack should already include screws, a servo arm, and self-tapping screws to secure the servo arm. The diameter of the hole on the head where the tilt-servo gearbox mounts is defined by `head_servo_mount_dia`.

The corresponding hole for the pan servo on the chassis is controlled by `chassis_pan_servo_slot_dia`.

#### Head neck

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount | Nuts | Variable                         |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | -------------------------------- |
| M2   | 6 or higher | 2      | 2    | `head_neck_pan_servo_screw_dia`  |
| M2   | 6 or higher | 2      | 2    | `head_neck_tilt_servo_screw_dia` |

#### IR Case for the Infrared LED Light Board

| Size | Length (mm) | Amount | Nuts | Variable                |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- | ----------------------- |
| M2   | 6 or higher | 2      | 2    | `ir_case_screw_dia`     |
| M2   | 6 or higher | 2      | 2    | `ir_case_rail_hole_dia` |

Variable `ir_case_screw_dia` defines the diameter of the screw holes that attach the case to the head; `ir_case_rail_hole_dia` defines the diameter of the rail holes that secure the IR LED to the case itself.

#### Ultrasonic case for HC-SR04

| Size | Length (mm)  | Amount | Nuts | Variable                          |
| ---- | ------------ | ------ | ---- | --------------------------------- |
| M2.5 | 10 or higher | 2 or 3 | 2    | `front_panel_connector_screw_dia` |
| M2.5 | 10 or higher | 2      | 2    | `front_panel_screw_dia`           |

`front_panel_connector_screw_dia` defines the diameter of the screw hole on the bracket that connects to the chassis, and `front_panel_screw_dia` defines the diameter of the screw hole on the front panel that secures the ultrasonic sensor, which is placed between the front panel and the bracket.
